This folder consists of an R package for the proposed nested group bridge method and the coding for the simulation studies and application in the manuscript.




1. Rpackage: the folder consists of an R package “ngr.tar.gz”.


2. functions.R: the R functions used to generate data for the simulation studies and implement the proposed nested group bridge method, the penalized B-splines method, the truncation methods A and B, the FLiRTI method and the SLoS method.


3. sim_NGR.R: the R code for the simulation study for the proposed nested group bridge method and the penalized B-splines method.


4. sim_TR.R: the R code for the simulation study for the truncation methods A and B.


5. sim_FLiRTI.R: the R code for the simulation study for the FLiRTI method.


6. sim_SLoS.R: the R code for the simulation study for the SLoS method.


7. sim_NGR_effect_gamma.R: the R code for investigating the effects of the group bridge parameter gamma.


8. Truck1Run1.csv: the particulate matter emissions data.


9. truck_analysis.R: the R code for analyzing the particulate matter emissions data by using the proposed nested group bridge method and the penalized B-splines method. 



Guidelines to run the codes:
1. Please run “sim_NGR.R”, “sim_TR.R”, “sim_FLiRTI.R” and “sim_SLoS.R” for replicating the simulation studies.
2. Please run “truck_analysis.R” for analyzing the particulate matter emissions data.
